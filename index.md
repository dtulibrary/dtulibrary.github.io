This is were developers at DTU library, team ISYS, can document some of their tasks and adventures!

We maintain the search engine [Findit](http://findit.dtu.dk)


We are working on a project so you can try our complete infrastructure on your own machine!
The only requirement is that you have **Docker** installed.

So far we have created a project which builds the Findit frontend, combined of multiple services.

You can download and build it here:
